## Photo album for my wife's birthday.

- Responsive.
- No data base: all the photos are in the front-end part.
- No framework used.
- Each page is in a different html file, to simulate a "component" logic.

## TODO:

- Do very quickly so a lot of things could be improve, but it works ...
- All images are the same, turn to use the grunt script to generate images from Desktop and for moviles and for different screen resolutions.
- Add comment/each photos.
